/**
 * Base Three.js scene — an orbiting starfield, plus the Scene 1 world layer
 * (the model) composited on top of it.
 *
 * The stars orbit the model's centre on roughly the model's own orbital plane,
 * each at its own randomised speed, so they read as one system with the stars
 * embedded in the model rather than as a separate dolly-ing backdrop. Mouse
 * parallax is layered on top via shared input state, lerped for smooth motion.
 *
 * Two render passes share one renderer, both drawn through the world layer's
 * bird's-eye camera — sharing the vantage is what makes the star orbits line up
 * with the model's. Depth is cleared between them so the model always sits in
 * front of the stars.
 * Palette: white/silver/gray only — no color pops.
